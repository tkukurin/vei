## VEI

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/Strange-Lab-AI/vei)

**VEI is infrastructure for enterprise AI agents.** It turns a company's real operational history — email, Slack, tickets, docs, CRM, GitHub, identity, observability, and agent traces — into one canonical event spine, then exposes that spine as replayable enterprise environments where agents can be tested, governed, audited, and improved before they touch production systems.

Try it now: [strangelab.ai/enron](https://strangelab.ai/enron) · [strangelab.ai/public-history](https://strangelab.ai/public-history)

One deterministic kernel, one event spine, five infrastructure surfaces:

1. **Test / Eval** — run agents against fixed company worlds before production.
2. **Governor / Control** — gate writes, record agent activity, and export evidence packs.
3. **Sandbox / What-if** — replay historical branch points and compare alternate actions as decision support.
4. **Train / Data** — turn traces and reviewed workflow specs into bounded process-training packages.
5. **Knowledge / Wiki / Skill Map** — compile company memory, recurring workflows, and draft agent skills from evidence.

## Product Surfaces

**Test / Eval** — Run fixed company worlds and score agents against contracts. Compare scripted, workflow, behavioral-cloning, and live LLM runners on the same scenario. See [docs/EVALS.md](docs/EVALS.md).

**Governor / Control** — Ingest agent activity from JSONL, MCP transcripts, or OpenAI org exports. Review access, blast radius, and policy compliance; gate writes and export evidence packs. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) § VEI Control.

**Sandbox / What-if** — Fork a world, change a policy or action, and compare alternate paths as decision support. Branch from real historical decisions in the Enron archive, from your own company data, or from public news timelines. See [docs/WHATIF.md](docs/WHATIF.md).

**Train / Data** — Turn traces into rollouts, demonstrations, and scoped training data. Mine repeated work from canonical company history, promote evidence-backed Business Task Specs, and package only reviewed contract-ready specs into process environments. See [docs/RL_GYM.md](docs/RL_GYM.md).

**Knowledge / Wiki / Skill Map** — Hydrate notes, transcripts, metrics, SOPs, and pricing into a knowledge graph; materialize a company wiki with citations; compile company-specific draft skills from the normalized bundle, with replay checks and evidence backing.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Strange-Lab-AI/vei.git
cd vei                # or your checkout folder name
make setup-full       # creates .venv, installs all extras
vei doctor            # checks environment
vei quickstart run    # launches Studio + Twin Gateway
```

`vei quickstart run` gives you:

- Studio at `http://127.0.0.1:3011`
- Twin Gateway at `http://127.0.0.1:3012`
- a seeded workspace with visible activity already in motion
- connection details in `.vei/quickstart.json`

**Requirements:** Python 3.11, ports 3011 and 3012 free. Local interactive LLM generation defaults to the Codex CLI (`gpt-5.3-codex-spark`). `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` is only needed for explicit direct-provider runs or CI-style `llm-live`.

For the optional JEPA backend by itself:

```bash
pip install -e ".[jepa]"
```

`make setup-full` already includes this extra for full local development.

### Try a saved example

Open the flagship Enron what-if bundle from a fresh clone — no API key needed:

```bash
vei ui serve \
  --root docs/examples/enron-master-agreement-public-context/workspace \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3055
```

Studio exposes the what-if surface as two explicit modes when both are available: **Live archive** for full-history exploration and **Saved reference** for the committed branch replay. Live archive remains the default and warms its loaded world in the UI server after status loads, so whole-history exploration stays visible without hiding behind the saved reference path.

### Experimental PipesHub Connector Pilot

VEI can also launch a local PipesHub stack and snapshot its synced enterprise
records into the same canonical company-history bundle. PipesHub remains a
separate connector/search service; VEI pulls a point-in-time snapshot and writes
reviewable local artifacts.

```bash
pip install -e ".[pipeshub]"

# Generate a local Compose profile and start PipesHub.
vei connectors pipeshub up

# Open http://127.0.0.1:3000, create the local PipesHub admin account, and
# configure connectors in the PipesHub UI. Personal Google accounts are fine
# for the Drive/Gmail pilot if you provide a Google OAuth desktop/web client
# ID + secret. Google Workspace Drive/Gmail connectors use the workspace
# service-account/domain-delegation path instead.
#
# Then export a PipesHub API token. The inspect/capture commands also accept
# --token-env if you store it elsewhere.
export PIPESHUB_BEARER_AUTH="<pipeshub bearer token>"

# Inspect what VEI can ingest.
vei context pipeshub inspect

# Pull a snapshot from PipesHub into VEI. Use gmail/drive for personal Google
# connectors, or gmailworkspace/driveworkspace for Workspace connectors.
vei context pipeshub capture \
  --workspace _vei_out/yourco \
  --org "YourCo" --domain "yourco.example" \
  --connector gmail \
  --connector drive \
  --connector jira \
  --connector confluence \
  --connector salesforce \
  --connector onedrive \
  --connector outlook \
  --since 2026-03-01T00:00:00Z

# Smoke the captured bundle through VEI's downstream read models.
vei context verify --snapshot _vei_out/yourco/context_snapshot.json
vei wiki build --source-dir _vei_out/yourco --output _vei_out/yourco/wiki
vei workflow mine --source-dir _vei_out/yourco --output _vei_out/yourco/workflows
vei context readiness --root _vei_out/yourco --format json

# Stop the local PipesHub stack when the pilot sync is finished.
vei connectors pipeshub down
```

The capture writes raw evidence under
`imports/source_syncs/pipeshub/<run_id>/`, then writes
`context_snapshot.json`, `canonical_events.jsonl`, and
`canonical_event_index.json`. Records keep their upstream system identity
— PipesHub is the transport, not the origin — so a Gmail message lands
under `provider="gmail"`, a Jira ticket under `provider="jira"`, a Drive
file under `provider="google"`, and so on. VEI does not maintain its own
provider allowlist at the command boundary; connector filters are resolved
against the configured PipesHub connectors when possible, then whatever
PipesHub serves is ingested under the source system it came from. The known
exceptions are Teams and ClickUp, which VEI reports as not yet supported by
mature PipesHub ingestion so they are not accidentally treated as normal
capture candidates. Records whose record type does not have a VEI-normalized
shape land in an `other` bucket on their provider so they remain discoverable
downstream.

The local launcher keeps the service boundary explicit. Generated Compose/env
files live under the VEI-managed runtime directory, PipesHub stores synced data
inside its own databases and indexes, and VEI only reads a reviewed snapshot.
For the local pilot, the launcher pins the PipesHub image and builds a small
local image layer to normalize deployment config parsing, keep Google Drive and
Gmail OAuth scopes read-only, and expose connector-owned records through the
PipesHub list/detail APIs. If a managed PipesHub deployment already exists, pass
`--base-url` to `inspect`/`capture` and skip the local launcher.

Canonical timeline events (`canonical_events.jsonl`) currently cover the
original provider set: gmail, slack/teams, jira/linear/github/gitlab/
clickup, google/notion/granola, salesforce/crm. PipesHub-sourced records
under other providers (outlook, onedrive, sharepoint, confluence, box,
dropbox, servicenow, ...) appear in the snapshot but do not yet generate
timeline events. See `vei/context/canonical_history.py` to widen.

Then explore branch points, run what-if experiments, build a wiki, or compile
a skill map — all from the same canonical event spine:

```bash
# 1. Rank strong branch points (no LLM, no training)
vei whatif candidates --source-dir _vei_out/yourco/context_snapshot.json --limit 10

# 2. Run a counterfactual. --mode e_jepa trains a structured-state JEPA on the
#    spine and predicts; --mode heuristic_baseline is deterministic and fast.
vei whatif experiment \
  --source-dir _vei_out/yourco/context_snapshot.json \
  --label first_experiment \
  --counterfactual-prompt "What if escalation had gone through legal first?" \
  --mode e_jepa --forecast-backend e_jepa

# 3. Build the company wiki (Overview, Recent Changes, Cases, People,
#    Knowledge, Skills, Evidence Index). Citations link back to canonical
#    events; nothing from synthetic vertical packs is mixed in.
vei wiki build --source-dir _vei_out/yourco/context_snapshot.json \
  --output _vei_out/yourco/wiki

# 4. Compile evidence-backed skills (LLM-derived, every step cited)
vei knowledge skillmap build \
  --source-dir _vei_out/yourco/context_snapshot.json \
  --output _vei_out/yourco/skill_map

# 5. When real agent activity has been imported into the workspace, refresh
#    skills + wiki from the context plus the Control evidence spine.
vei knowledge skillmap refresh --workspace _vei_out/yourco \
  --output _vei_out/yourco/skill_map
vei wiki refresh --workspace _vei_out/yourco

# 6. Mine recurring work and promote an evidence-backed task spec.
vei workflow mine \
  --source-dir _vei_out/yourco/context_snapshot.json \
  --output _vei_out/yourco/workflows
vei workflow promote \
  --root _vei_out/yourco/workflows \
  --candidate-id <candidate-id> \
  --output _vei_out/yourco/workflows/task_spec.json
```

Hardening smokes for public-facing paths:

```bash
make codex-live-smoke      # Codex-backed planning, skillmap, and what-if smoke
make worldmodel-smoke      # JEPA/reference world-model contracts
make public-demo-smoke     # strangelab.ai/enron and /public-history assets
make workflow-intel-smoke  # workflow mining/spec/package gates
```

Run a real LLM agent against the resulting twin via MCP stdio:

```bash
vei eval llm-test run \
  --provider openai --model gpt-5 \
  --task "Triage the open exception and reply to the customer." \
  --artifacts _vei_out/yourco/llm_run
```

## Repo Checks

```bash
make check          # format, lint, types, import boundaries, security
make test           # fast tests (skips slow)
make check-full     # + bandit, semgrep, detect-secrets
make test-full      # full suite with coverage
make llm-live       # needs live API keys
make clean-workspace  # clears caches; leaves _vei_out/ runs alone
```

Exit codes: `0` pass · `1` test/gate failure · `2` cost ceiling exceeded · `3` infrastructure failure · `4` threshold/config missing.
