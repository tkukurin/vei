# Onboarding (Humans and Agents)

This is the one starting document for anyone — human or AI agent — working on VEI. It explains what VEI is, how to run it, and how to navigate the codebase.

**If you have 10 minutes, do these five things:**

1. `make setup-full` — creates `.venv` with all extras
2. `vei quickstart run` — launches Studio + Twin Gateway with a live synthetic workspace
3. `vei ui serve --root docs/examples/enron-master-agreement-public-context/workspace --port 3055` — opens the flagship Enron what-if bundle
4. `vei eval benchmark --runner workflow --family security_containment` — runs the deterministic eval baseline
5. Read the [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) for every term of art

## What VEI Is

VEI is infrastructure for enterprise AI agents. It turns company or historical records and agent traces into one canonical event spine, then exposes that spine through the CLI, Studio UI, twin gateway, branch-point what-if experiments, company wiki, skill-map compilation, and learned world-model benchmarks.

The practical job is usually one of these things:

- run a deterministic enterprise scenario and score an agent
- turn real historical records into a canonical timeline
- ingest agent-activity evidence and review VEI Control reports
- compile company-specific draft skills from the normalized company bundle
- mine repeated work into evidence-backed Business Task Specs for review
- train or apply the JEPA-style world model to score alternate actions as decision support

Use counterfactual rankings as decision-support hypotheses for human or expert review. Factual prediction is the strongest evidence.

## Start Here

Read these next when needed:

- `README.md` for setup and operator flows
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the module map, five infrastructure surfaces, and what is and isn't learned
- `docs/GLOSSARY.md` for every term of art defined in one place
- `docs/EXAMPLES.md` for worked examples (Enron, public history, Clearwater)
- `docs/WHATIF.md` for the world-model and what-if command reference
- `docs/EVALS.md` for the three-layer evaluation framework
- `docs/RL_GYM.md` for the scoped contract-only RL-training plan
- `AGENTS.md` for repo policy, eval runners, and validation expectations
- `Makefile` and `.agents.yml` before changing gates or CI behavior

Use the repo command surface:

```bash
make check        # format, lint, types, import boundaries, security
make test         # fast tests (skips slow)
make check-full   # + bandit, semgrep, detect-secrets
make test-full    # full suite with coverage
```

## Repo Map

- `vei/world/` holds the deterministic world-session kernel and replayable state.
- `vei/router/` exposes the MCP tool surface over the kernel.
- `vei/structure/` builds the event-derived read model and truth-comparison helpers.
- `vei/twin/` exposes the HTTP governed twin surface.
- `vei/workspace/` and `vei/run/` hold the file-backed workspace and run model.
- `vei/skillmap/` compiles evidence-backed, replay-checked company skills from normalized bundles.
- `vei/ingest/agent_activity/` captures external agent behavior from JSONL landing zones, MCP transcripts, and OpenAI org usage/audit evidence.
- `vei/provenance/` builds Control reports: timeline, activity graph, access review, blast radius, policy replay, and OTel export.
- `vei/whatif/` handles branch-point replay, counterfactuals, benchmarks, and saved example bundles.
- `vei/workflow/` mines recurring work and promotes declarative Business Task Specs. It does not define a generic orchestrator or deterministic script by default.
- `vei/verticals/` holds seeded business packs and overlays.
- `tests/` covers the repo. `tests/dynamics/` also emits `_vei_out/dynamics_eval/metrics.json`.

Keep cross-module calls behind typed module APIs, usually `some_module/api.py`. Keep local secrets in `.env`. Do not commit `_vei_out/`, `.artifacts/`, private exports, generated prompts, raw archives, or ad hoc traces.

## Basic Use

Install the full development extras:

```bash
make setup-full
```

`make setup` is a lighter alternative that skips worldmodel, jepa, test, rl, and browser extras.
For a focused install of the optional JEPA backend:

```bash
pip install -e ".[jepa]"
```

Useful entrypoints:

```bash
vei quickstart run
vei eval benchmark --runner workflow --family security_containment
vei knowledge skillmap build --source-dir _vei_out/<tenant>/context_snapshot.json --output _vei_out/<tenant>/skill_map
vei workspace ingest agent-activity --source agent_activity_jsonl --path ./logs --workspace _vei_out/<tenant>
vei knowledge skillmap refresh --workspace _vei_out/<tenant> --output _vei_out/<tenant>/skill_map
vei provenance access-review --agent-id <agent-id> --workspace _vei_out/<tenant>
vei provenance verify --workspace _vei_out/<tenant>
vei provenance export --format evidence-pack --workspace _vei_out/<tenant> --output _vei_out/<tenant>/evidence_pack.json
vei workflow mine --source-dir _vei_out/<tenant>/context_snapshot.json --output _vei_out/<tenant>/workflows
vei workflow label --root _vei_out/<tenant>/workflows --candidate-id <candidate-id> --label good_example --note "source-backed example"
vei workflow promote --root _vei_out/<tenant>/workflows --candidate-id <candidate-id> --output _vei_out/<tenant>/workflows/task_spec.json
vei ui serve --root docs/examples/enron-master-agreement-public-context/workspace --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3055
```

Eval runners:

- `workflow` is the reference runner.
- `scripted` is the deterministic floor baseline.
- `bc` is the tool-frequency baseline powered by `FrequencyPolicy`.
- `llm` runs a real model through the MCP world. For `vei eval benchmark
  --runner llm --family <family>`, VEI derives the task and argument anchors
  from the family workflow, then reports both enterprise scoring and exact
  workflow-contract validation.

Same seed means same world. Determinism is part of the product. User-facing LLM
generation defaults to the local Codex CLI using `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`; direct
provider APIs are explicit overrides.

## Canonical Inputs

For each tenant, prefer a VEI bundle with:

- `context_snapshot.json`
- `canonical_events.jsonl`
- `canonical_event_index.json`

Source records may be email, ClickUp, Notion, docs, tickets, CRM, meeting notes, news articles, or other time-bearing records. The key requirement is that they can be canonicalized into dated events with enough thread or case structure to build pre-branch state and future tails.

Check readiness before training:

```bash
python scripts/check_tenant_world_model.py --root _vei_out/<tenant>/context_snapshot.json
```

Workflow mining consumes the same bundle. Business Task Specs start as
descriptive or labeled artifacts. Promote them to contract/RL packaging only
when deterministic success and failure predicates are actually present.
Use the `metadata` field for tenant-specific or experimental context, but keep
common workflow concepts in typed fields. If the same metadata key starts
appearing across companies, promote it into the `BusinessTaskSpec` schema instead
of letting metadata become the real product contract.

## Advanced: World Model

> This section covers the JEPA-style learned world model, strategic state points, leakage rules, and counterfactual workflows. Skip it if you're just getting started with the repo.
>
> For the canonical breakdown of what is learned vs. heuristic vs. external, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) § What Is and Isn't Learned.
> For the training-loop diagram, target factory, and trust boundaries, see [WORLD_MODEL_TRAINING.md](WORLD_MODEL_TRAINING.md).

### Mental model

The world-model loop is:

```text
raw work or news data
-> canonical timestamped events
-> archive-derived doctrine packet
-> temporal train / validation / test split
-> JEPA learns: doctrine text + current state + action -> future heads
-> decision points selected from pre-branch signals
-> candidate actions generated from pre-branch context only
-> JEPA scores the candidate futures
-> CSV / Markdown results reviewed by humans
```

The model predicts a bundle of future heads, not one universal truth number. The single score in decision tables is a convenience score built from those predicted heads for a balanced decision objective.

### Pooled training

Build one pooled benchmark from all timestamp-ready tenants. Hold out the final tail of each tenant timeline for testing.

```bash
vei whatif benchmark build-multitenant \
  --input enron=_vei_out/enron/context_snapshot.json \
  --input tenant_a=_vei_out/tenant_a/context_snapshot.json \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/world_model_multitenant_jepa \
  --label enron_private_tenant \
  --candidate-mode template

vei whatif benchmark train \
  --root _vei_out/world_model_multitenant_jepa/enron_private_tenant \
  --model-id jepa_latent \
  --train-split train --train-split validation \
  --validation-split test

vei whatif benchmark eval \
  --root _vei_out/world_model_multitenant_jepa/enron_private_tenant \
  --model-id jepa_latent
```

Report factual metrics first: AUROC when defined, Brier score, calibration error, business-head MAE, and objective-head MAE.

### Decision points and counterfactuals

Use strategic state-point runs when the user wants concrete choices a manager, editor, or analyst could have made. This is the only user-facing counterfactual interface.

```bash
vei whatif benchmark strategic-state-points \
  --input tenant_a=_vei_out/datasets/tenant_a/context_snapshot.json \
  --checkpoint _vei_out/world_model_multitenant_jepa/current/model_runs/jepa_latent/model.pt \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/world_model_strategic_state_points \
  --label current_strategic_state_points \
  --decisions-per-tenant 3 \
  --candidates-per-decision 8 \
  --proposal-mode llm \
  --proposal-model gpt-5.3-codex-spark
```

See [WHATIF.md](WHATIF.md) § Strategic state-point counterfactual runs for the full reference.

### Leakage rules

Never let the candidate generator or judge see the recorded future tail.

Required checks:

- no held-out branch event IDs leak into fit rows
- train, validation, and test splits are temporal by tenant
- candidate-generation prompts contain only pre-branch context
- generated candidates contain no future-tail event markers
- judge dossiers contain no future-tail event markers or model scores
- generated candidates record prompt hash, evidence hash, model, source, and `no_future_context=true`

If any leakage check fails, do not make model-performance claims from that run.

### Artifact names

Supported what-if forecast filenames:

- `whatif_ejepa_result.json`
- `whatif_reference_result.json`
- `whatif_heuristic_baseline_result.json`

Use `whatif_reference_result.json` as the main saved forecast artifact for repo-owned Enron bundles. Import constants from `vei.whatif.filenames` or `vei.whatif.api`.

## Cleanup

After large runs, inspect before deleting:

```bash
du -sh _vei_out
make clean-workspace-dry-run
make clean-workspace-hard-dry-run
git status --short --branch
```

Use `make clean-workspace` for low-risk cache/build cleanup. It leaves `_vei_out` runs alone. Use `make clean-workspace-hard` only when the user approves a cutover that discards old generated VEI runs; it preserves `_vei_out/world_model_current/`, `_vei_out/datasets/`, and `_vei_out/llm_live/latest/`.
